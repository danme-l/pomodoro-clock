# Pomodoro Clock

Final Project from the [Front End development](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) cert on Free Code Camp. This is a Pomodoro clock that has alternate timers for focus and break sessions based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) for productivity. It defaults to a 25 minute focus session and 5 minute break session that can be started and stopped. Done with React.
